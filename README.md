# Bandit Algorithms: Fractional Factorial Thompson Sampling via Unified Skew-Normal
This repository contains the scripts for my master thesis on Fractional Factorial Thompson Sampling via Unified Skew-Normal distribution. The scripts heavily rely  on White (2013), but significantly build on them. 
The repo is divided into 3 different types of codes:
1) A ```Class``` folder, which contains the codes for the all the algorithms treated in the thesis
2) A ```Test``` folder, which contains the testing functions and define the horizons
3) A ```Flow``` folder, which contains the dataset generating the test-beds and that runs all the algorithms. 
Codes are written in Python, with the help of some R commands as well
